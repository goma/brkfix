Authors of the brk/fix utilities for decomposition and recomposition of goma
finite element problems.

2.0 - upgraded to do a unique element decomposition for VOF and
      discontinuous Galerkin simulations with GOMA.

	Added some minor cosmetic memory alloc/dealloc checking etc.
	No more aalloc, just smalloc.

1.0 - bare bones static full nodal based dof decomposition only

	"I owe a debt to Sam Subia and Adonis Kassinos for stress
	 testing this utility and finding bugs. Hopefully, the way those bugs
	 have been fixed make this a better tool."
